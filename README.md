# Hardhat convenient starter

This starter created with 6 month of full time solidity development in mind. It extends [hardhat-boilerplate](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat-boilerplate) repository with things that I found myself add in every new project that I was starting.

## What's changed?

- Typescript instead of js
- Solhint for linting
- More elaborate hardhat config
- Added plugins in VS workspace recommendations
- Added test contracts for ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155 tokens
- Installed commonly used contract libraries

## Contract libraries

- Open Zeppelin
- Open Zeppelin Upgradable
- Chainlink
- ERC721A
