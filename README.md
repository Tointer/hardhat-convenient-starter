# Hardhat convenient starter

This starter created with 6 month of full time solidity development in mind. It extends hardhat-boilerplate repository with things that I found myself add in every new project that I was starting.

## What's changed?

1. Typescript instead of js
2. Solhint for linting
3. More elaborate hardhat config
4. Added plugins in VS workspace recommendations
5. Added test contracts for ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155 tokens
6. Installed commonly used contract libraries

## Contract libraries

1. Open Zeppelin
2. Open Zeppelin Upgradable
3. Chainlink
4. ERC721A
